# Welcome to the Spec-SLA-Bot!

SLA requires that assignees to PRs in the azure-rest-api-specs repository acknowledge the PR within 24 hours of the PR assignment. The Spec-SLA-Bot helps assignees abide by the SLA by sending email reminders and a weekly summary of SLA violations to the team managaer.
